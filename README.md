# CS50P Assignments

Welcome to the repository for CS50P assignments! This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from Harvard's CS50P course.

## About Me

I took the CS50P course after my high school graduation as an introduction to programming using the Python language. The course provided a comprehensive understanding of fundamental programming concepts, including functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, classes, objects, file handling, and more. It was a hands-on learning experience with real-world exercises, offering plenty of opportunities for practice.

## How to Use This Repository
